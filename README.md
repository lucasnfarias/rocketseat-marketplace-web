- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/installation): making css less difficult (still difficult though)
- [UI Shadcn](https://ui.shadcn.com/docs): Beautifully designed components that you can copy and paste into your apps. Accessible. Customizable. Open Source.

- [Zod](https://zod.dev/): TypeScript-first schema validation with static type inference
- [React Query](https://tanstack.com/query/latest/docs/framework/react/overview): often described as the missing data-fetching library for web applications, but in more technical terms, it makes fetching, caching, synchronizing and updating server state in your web applications a breeze.
